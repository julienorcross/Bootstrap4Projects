- fun title font from google fonts (add a black dropshadow too maybe?)
- kebab case 
x fix outline on focus on input and plus button and modal buttons
- make delete icons (use font awesome or something else) maybe inside a circle or something
x lighter text on placeholders for inputs
x plus button hover is too dark
x javascript logic to prevent adding an empty item 
x cancel hover background should be lighter
- slightly less and more consistent vertical spacing above the table (table is good)
x modal button text is way smaller - should be bigger
x more space between modal buttons when hovering on cancel
